# Hello There! Meet MCDI!
A Python application/library for Minecraft to build redstone musics, pictures or videos conveniently from MIDI files. 

## Getting started
To run this app, you need:
+ Python 3.8 or newer
  + Package: mido (+ rtmidi-python)
  + Package: pillow (PIL)
  + Package: opencv-python (cv2)
  
This app creates music by generating mcfunction(s), so only **Minecraft (Java Edition) 1.13 or newer** are supported. 

## Frondends
+ soma: Generates music that is played by the [soma](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-709092-1-1.html) resource pack, which has more instruments and better sound quality. 
+ vanilla: Generates music that can be directly played in Minecraft without having any resource pack installed. 
+ mcrg (beta): Generates music that is played by the resource pack generated by [mcrg](https://github.com/ExMatics/mcrg).

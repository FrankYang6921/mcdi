# Hello There! Meet MCDI!
A Python application/library for Minecraft to build redstone musics(vocals) conveniently from MIDI or VPR files. 

## Getting started
To run this app, you need:
+ Python 3.8 or newer
  + Package: mido (+ rtmidi-python)
  + Package: pillow (PIL)
  
This app creates music by generating mcfunction(s), so only **Minecraft (Java Edition) 1.13 or newer** are supported. 

## See how cool this thing is!

## We even have a GUI!
Run gui_main.py, and then you get a GUI application which is really simple to use!

## Frondends
+ Soma: Generates music that is played by the [soma](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-709092-1-1.html) resource pack, which has more instruments and better sound quality. 
+ Vanilla: Generates music that can be directly played in Minecraft without having any resource pack installed, which is simpler. 
+ MCRG (beta): Generates music that is played by the resource pack generated by [mcrg](https://github.com/ExMatics/mcrg), highly customizable.

## Plugins
+ Progress: Shows a progress bar on the top of the screen.
+ Piano Fall: Shows a fancy piano fall (using entity falling_sand), **just for fun.**
+ Piano Roll: Shows a fancy piano roll (and with plenty of effects), **just for fun.**

## Middlewares
\[Nothing here for the time being.\]
